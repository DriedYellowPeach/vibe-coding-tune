# Claude Code Global Settings

This file serves as a global settings file for the project-level Claude.

## General Rules

### Manage Claude Related Files

When you start to collaborate a project, you should:

- **Always** Use `.claude/` as the root directory for all files generated by Claude
- **Always** Put project-level `CLAUDE.md` in `.claude/` directory, not at project root. Use `CLAUDE.md` as project-level instructions and settings.
- **Always** create `HISTORY.md` which keep records of our conversations using the format bellow, you should use `date` commands to generate the time for the header. When I tell you to keep records of our conversations, you should append the conversation to `HISTORY.md` file.

  ```markdown
  ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

  ### User Request

  <my request>

  ### Claude's Answer

  <claude's answer>
  ```

- **Always** create `PLAN.md` for the project, you will use this file to:
  - Keep record of the plan you created for the project.
  - The plan I made for the project, which you should follow

The plan should have this format:

```markdow

## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

### <Task Summary>

Task objective and details.

### <Todos>


```

### Writing Style

- Don't use emojis in `CLAUDE.md` files, or any other markdown files.
- For todo lists, use `- [ ]` for unchecked items and `- [x]` for checked items.
- Use backticks for:
  - directory and file name.
  - inline code snippets.
  - triple backticks for code blocks.
