# Claude Code Global Settings

This file serves as a global settings file for the project-level Claude.

## General Rules

### Manage Claude Related Files

When you start to collaborate a project, you should:

- **Always** Use `.claude/` as the root directory for all files generated by Claude
- **Always** Put project-level `CLAUDE.md` in `.claude/` directory, not at project root. Use `CLAUDE.md` as project-level instructions and settings.
- **Always** create `HISTORY.md` which keep records of our conversations using the format bellow, you should use `date` commands to generate the time for the header. When I tell you to keep records of our conversations, you should append the conversation to `HISTORY.md` file.

  ```markdown
  ## YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

  ### User Request

  <my request>

- **Always** create `plans/plan_<sequence number>.md` for the project, you will use this file to:
  - When I ask you to create a new plan, you should create file `plans/plan_<sequence number>.md` using the `<Plan Template>`, `<sequence number>` should be the next integer in sequence, starting from `000`.

Here is the `<Plan Template>`

```markdow

# Plan <Sequence Number>

- Time: <date>

## Objectives

## Details
```

- **Always** create `tasks/task_<sequence number>.md` when you follow `plans/plan<sequence number>.md` to finish your job, the plan and task should be in one-to-one correspondence, you should use the `<Task Template>` to create the file, `<sequence number>` should be the next integer in sequence, starting from `000`.
  - When you generate todo lists, you should put todo lists in this file
  - When you finish a todos, you should update this file

### Writing Style

- Don't use emojis in `CLAUDE.md` files, or any other markdown files.
- For todo lists, use `- [ ]` for unchecked items and `- [x]` for checked items.
- Use backticks for:
  - directory and file name.
  - inline code snippets.
  - triple backticks for code blocks.
